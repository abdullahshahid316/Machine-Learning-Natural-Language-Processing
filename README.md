Machine-Learning-Natural-Language-Processing
This repository is centered around a Jupyter notebook that documents the process of creating and assessing a machine learning model tailored for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project encapsulates a comprehensive workflow that includes stages of data processing, constructing a model using sequential neural networks integrated with embedding layers, followed by its training and validation.

Key highlights of the project:

Usage of visual representations to illustrate loss and accuracy metrics.

In-depth analysis of the model's performance, with a focus on aspects such as overfitting and the impact of embedding layers.

A methodical and segmented approach to tackling various components of the project, aiding in understanding the overarching objectives and results.

This work exemplifies a meticulous and structured method in analyzing text data and developing predictive models, offering a valuable resource for similar endeavors in NLP. Each small task completed contributes to the broader understanding and success of the project.
